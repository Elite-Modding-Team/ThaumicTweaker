Make sure that the bug you are reporting happens on the LATEST version of the mod, especially if you are playing on a modpack that hasn't been updated in awhile. It is likely that the bug you are reporting has already been fixed and will count as an invalid issue.

If you're experiencing a crash regarding ThaumTweaks, it is not compatible with ThaumicTweaker because it overrides specific parts of Thaumcraft's classes that this mod injects into. We won't be able to fix this.
